## 🔐 **About Me**
My journey began with a deep curiosity about how things break and how to fix them better.
Over the years, I've focused on making security practical, human-centered, and seamlessly integrated into real-world systems. Whether it’s securing IoT ecosystems, embedding trust in AI systems, or building resilient DevSecOps pipelines, I’ve found that the best solutions come from listening deeply, thinking across disciplines, and never losing sight of the people behind the systems.
I care about building not just secure code, but secure cultures, where teams collaborate, learn from threats, and treat security as a shared responsibility. My work spans threat modeling, cryptographic design, secure architectures, and deep learning for malware and anomaly detection. But more than the tools or techniques, I’m driven by the impact: enabling organizations to move faster, safer, and with more confidence.

This space is where I document the journey, experiments, projects, ideas, and the occasional rabbit holes.

💡 *"Security should be **built-in**, not **bolted-on**."*
